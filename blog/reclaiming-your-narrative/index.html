<p>We live in an era where your <strong>Google search results</strong> are your first impression. For many, this becomes a source of anxiety — especially when fragments of their past appear, taken out of context or frozen in time.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth: <em>You are not your search results.</em><br/>
You are a dynamic, evolving person — and the web should reflect that.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-site-exists">Why This Site Exists</h2>
<p>I launched this site to create an anchor — a <strong>place of truth</strong> that reflects who I am now, not who I once was, or what others chose to document.</p>
<p>By owning my domain name and publishing openly, I’m taking control of the narrative. I’m also showing that it’s possible to meet the modern world with <strong>accountability</strong>, without giving up your humanity in the process.</p>
<h2 id="the-ethics-of-presence">The Ethics of Presence</h2>
<p>Reclaiming narrative isn’t about erasure. It’s about <strong>contextualization</strong>.<br/>
Yes, I’ve been through difficult, public moments — court cases, personal growth, and hard-earned lessons. These don’t define me, but they inform the work I do now: building ethical systems, advocating for transparency, and creating tools that reflect the complexity of real life.</p>

<h2 id="build-your-own-mirror">Build Your Own Mirror</h2>
<p>This site — and the systems I contribute to — are my way of writing.<br/>
If you’re reading this because you searched my name, I invite you to look deeper. You’ll find a person still learning, still building, and still showing up.</p>
<p>Thanks for being here.</p>
