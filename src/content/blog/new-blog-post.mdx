We live in an era where your **Google search results** are your first impression. For many, this becomes a source of anxiety — especially when fragments of their past appear, taken out of context or frozen in time.

But here's the truth: _You are not your search results._  
You are a dynamic, evolving person — and the web should reflect that.

## Why This Site Exists

I launched this site to create an anchor — a **place of truth** that reflects who I am now, not who I once was, or what others chose to document.

By owning my domain name and publishing openly, I'm taking control of the narrative. I'm also showing that it's possible to meet the modern world with **accountability**, without giving up your humanity in the process.

## The Ethics of Presence

Reclaiming narrative isn't about erasure. It's about **contextualization**.  
Yes, I've been through difficult, public moments — court cases, personal growth, and hard-earned lessons. These don't define me, but they inform the work I do now: building ethical systems, advocating for transparency, and creating tools that reflect the complexity of real life.

## Build Your Own Mirror

This site — and the systems I contribute to — are my way of writing.  
If you're reading this because you searched my name, I invite you to look deeper. You'll find a person still learning, still building, and still showing up.

Thanks for being here.
